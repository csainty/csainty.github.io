We have been having a very eventful weekend here in Newcastle.
It all started with a coal ship grounding itself on one of our beaches, then the weather moved on to what the excited are calling cyclonic conditions.
Lots of damage has been caused, flooding, trees down, cars floating away.

Here are some of my pictures from around the area ([link](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zeph_travels)).
Everyone close to me is safe and well.

In other news Visual Studio 2005 made my laptop very very unhappy. There was no performance what so ever, it took hours to run the install program from SP1. It has improved after getting all the service packs on but simply is not working, fails to create projects. I run as Administrator, change file permissions on the directories I am trying to use and still no use, gives no help as to hy it failed either, just says project creation failed.
I think I might try start over. Damn Vista.
