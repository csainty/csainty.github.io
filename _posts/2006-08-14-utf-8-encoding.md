I was recently working on creating RSS feeds dynamically from a product database, and kept finding they would not validate due to invalid characters being used for UTF-8 encoding.
I found a quick one liner that seems to tidy this up, albeit in a way i'm somewhat less than comfortable with (I never did exhaustive tests to be sure it didnt mess with the valid data in some way). Anyway here is my code

```

cStr=Â strconv(strconv(m.cStr,11),9)
```


Has anyone done a similar thing before and have a better solution? Or better yet put my mind at ease that I have no reason to dislike this one.
