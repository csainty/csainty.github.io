Back at work after a long and refreshing holiday, full of new energy.
Which means it is time to start looking at some new tech.
I have spent the last day or so wrestling with Microsoft CRM 3.0 trying to get it to install. Still no luck yet, but I have a few things left to try. I saw a presentation by Adam Cogan at the [Newcastle Coders Group](http://www.ncg.asn.au/), while not quite meeting the idea I had for it in my head, it looks worthwhile investigating further.
At the same time I am about to embark on a full exploration of Visual Studio 2005 and C# as a future development platform for Quids. Complete with a copy of [Mere Mortals.NET](http://www.oakleafsd.com/) I am bound to have a fun weekend. More on that later though.
