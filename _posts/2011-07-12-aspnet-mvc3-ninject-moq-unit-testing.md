I answered a question on StackOverflow yesterday which I am pretty happy with, so I thought I would share the link on here.  
  
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646244/mvc-3-how-to-learn-how-to-test-with-nunit-ninject-and-moq/6646591#6646591](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646244/mvc-3-how-to-learn-how-to-test-with-nunit-ninject-and-moq/6646591#6646591)  
  
The question asks for general advice on how to write and test an ASP.NET MVC 3 website that correctly uses Inversion-of-Control, Unit Testing and Mocking.
