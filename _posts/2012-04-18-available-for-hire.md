Next week, after more than 11 years, I will be leaving Quids in search of a new adventure. In fact I will be hoping to roll two adventures into one, a new job and a new country.  
I’ll keep this blog post relatively short so if you want to talk details drop me an email at [csainty@hotmail.com](mailto:csainty@hotmail.com)

#### Let’s begin with the job.

Having worked my entire career with a single company, I am very open minded about the next step in my career. The most important factor is going to be the products I am developing. Something in the consumer web or mobile space would get me the most excited.  

My professional experience is largely on the Microsoft stack. C#, SQL, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Phone 7 and all the related tools you use when doing Microsoft development. If you flick through my blog though you will find a lot of recent interest in Node.js, RavenDB and many other OSS tools.  
I have no problem picking up new languages and have plenty of real world non-technical experience that transfers to any set of tools I might need to use.  

#### So what about this second adventure?

Not content with simply changing jobs my wife and I are also looking to move overseas. The primary focus is Europe, and top of the list is Copenhagen, Denmark. Most parts of Europe are open to consideration though. I won’t bore you with details here, if you would like to know a few more reasons I am more than happy to have a chat.  

#### Job Hunting

The search is already underway. I have found a couple of decent sites to search on [it-jobbank.dk](http://it-jobbank.dk/), [dk.indeed.com](http://dk.indeed.com/) and [careers.stackoverflow.com](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) to name a few. I have also been tracking down individual companies based in the regions that interest me.  
We all know that not every job is advertised though. So if you are interested or know someone that might be, I would love to hear from you.
