We had a good meeting in Sydney last night, a good turn out considering both Craig and Andrew were absent (a first?)
The powerpoint from my session, plus a few code snippets I used (a couple will not work as they have external dependencies) can be found [here](http://www.quids.com.au/users/UG/November%202006%20-%20Chris%20-%20Performance.zip).
Sadly a lot of the best content came up during the many questions asked in the session, so if you were not there, you miss out.
For lots more information and code snippets / timings, check out the Performance topics on the Fox Wiki ([link](http://fox.wikis.com/wc.dll?Wiki~CategoryPerformance))

Also remember to check out [Oz Fox](http://www.ozfox.com.au/) and sign up.
