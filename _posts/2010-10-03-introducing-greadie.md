Today I am showing off the first peek at a Windows Phone 7 application I have been working on recently.

The premise is simple, gReadie is a Google Reader client for the Windows Phone 7 platform. In this apparently Twitter and Facebook addicted world, I guess blogs are becoming out of date, but I still use Google Reader daily on my PC and iPhone, so I will have at least one user.

The application is ready for a first release, though I am still adding features to it, so as soon as the Marketplace is open for submissions I will be ready to put something up.

I have implemented a trial version (great idea ported over from the XBox Live Arcade), but I also hope to investigate the advertising integration Microsoft has developed and see if I can run an ad-supported free version along with the paid and trial versions.

If time permits I hope to do a few blog posts on the more interesting sides of Windows Phone 7 development. I have played around with a couple of apps now and even some games (Pong!) so I am getting more comfortable with the platform.

I have to say I am really keen to get my hands on an actual device and see how these apps run up in the real world, but it looks like it could be Christmas before we get a release here in Australia.
