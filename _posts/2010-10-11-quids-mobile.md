I have set up a quick WordPress site today to host information about our mobile development separately to our main software site. I will also use it to post future updates rather than polluting my otherwise coding focussed blog.  
  
So for anyone interested in following the apps we create head over to [www.quidsmobile.com](http://www.quidsmobile.com/)  
  
I promise I will make my next post about something I have learnt on the new platform and get back onto a technology focus.
