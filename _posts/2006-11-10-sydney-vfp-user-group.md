I have been invited to speak at November's User Group in Sydney ([link](http://www.svfpug.com.au/)).
I will be talking about some of the techniques and tools I employed when tuning the performance of the Harris Technology website ([link](http://www.ht.com.au/)).
This will include Caching, Coverage Profiler, Load Testing etc
If anyone has any specifics they would like to know about, drop me an email or leave a comment and I'll see if I can include it.
