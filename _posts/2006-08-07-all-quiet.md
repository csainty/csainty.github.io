So things have been a bit quiet on here the last few months.
I will hide behind the classic excuse of being very busy with the launch of a new website for one of our clients.

If you would like to check it out head over to [www.ht.com.au](http://www.ht.com.au/).

The website is all fox (front-end and database) running on Web Connect 4.68
5.0 was released too far into the development of the site to spend the time upgrading before launch, it is something we will look at though.

There is scope for a number of articles in the development of this site, so keep an eye out for those as I get back into blogging.
