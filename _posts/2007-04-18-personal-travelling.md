Just a personal note,
I leave this afternoon for a bit over 5 weeks of vacation.
First stop is Yokkaichi Japan, where my brother currently lives teaching English.
Then it is off to Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, should be an amazing trip with some beautiful scenery. A great chance to recharge a few batteries.
I will be back in Australia on the 25th of May
