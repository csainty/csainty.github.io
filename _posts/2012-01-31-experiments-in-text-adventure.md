Like many who were into computers “back in the day” I still maintain a nostalgic, warm and fuzzy feeling at the memory of early text based adventure games.  
  
Back when all I knew were the PRINT and INPUT commands in QBASIC, these were the very first programs I created.  
  
Where am I going with this?  
  
Well over the weekend I was learning the [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js) presentation library and thought to myself that it really was a beautiful way to display text in a web browser. Then a little light bulb went off in my head.  
  
3 hours later, I had forked impress.js and used it’s HTML5 canvas and CSS3 animations to create an engine for a modern text adventure game.  
  
You can see the results of that intense session of programming here [http://csainty.github.com/ImpressGame](http://csainty.github.com/ImpressGame)  
  
I have quite a few other ideas for what I could do with this underlying concept. If it eventually comes together as I see it, it will be beautiful.
