I received notification this morning that gReadie will be accepted into the early access program for the Windows Phone 7 Marketplace. So sometime Monday I will be logging in and submitting. Hopefully it also means the app will be in the marketplace from day 1.  
  
I recorded one last video that takes a run right through the app. I already have a huge list of features to go into future releases but the last few days have involved making sure the app is well tested and running as nicely as I can manage on the emulator. I am very keen to get a real device and see how it goes on there.
