Today I am introducing what I hope will be a long term project for this blog, my “Learn Something New” series.  
 
The series will be mainly focussed on web development and learning the basics of a tool or framework I did not previously know. Where possible I will be providing all the source on GitHub and links to the project up and running on a free cloud service like AppHarbor or Heroku.  
 
To set a few ground rules  
  These projects will not be “best practice”. Where possible I am trying to focus on a single new piece of kit and anything else will be kept at a minimum to make it work.  Unless the post is about a UI tool, then there is likely to be no design work put into the project. See point 1, I am aiming for a quick turn around on each project. These will be frameworks and tools I am new to, so I may make mistakes and I may do things the wrong way. If you see me doing that, I would be more than happy to hear from you and pointed in the right direction. 
In the end this is some motivation and structure to my own learning. The blog gets to come along for the ride. So set your expectations appropriately and everything should be cool.
