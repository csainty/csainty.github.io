Just a quick FYI to let people know I am now on Twitter with my own account [@csainty](http://www.twitter.com/csainty).   
  
Up until now I have been using the [@quidsmobile](http://www.twitter.com/quidsmobile) account for a mix of personal comments and supporting gReadie. It will go full-time WP7 app support now.  
  
All my blog posts will be announced on my new personal account, along with other little comments on programming and tech.
