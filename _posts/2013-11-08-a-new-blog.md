I've just switched my blog over to a new host. Finally saying goodbye to blogger after more than 7 years.

The new setup is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on GitHub.

Hopefully I didn't trigger _"new"_ posts in your feed reader.

I still have some older posts to tidy up, but overall the process has gone fairly smoothly.

I'm looking forward to getting some new posts on here soon. See you then!
