Microsoft has just released a beta of their new Game Studio Express product.

A very ambitious and pretty exciting move I think, opening up game development in a big way on both PC and Xbox360 (thats right you can make 360 games with this stuff)
Going to be interesting to see the sorts of things people do with the tech over time, and if other consoles now feel they have to match the home brew capabilities of the 360.
I have no previous experience in this style of programming, but it is something I have long intended to pursue, might be about time I think. Get my head out of the database.
