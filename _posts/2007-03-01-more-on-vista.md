I been seeing a strange quirk pop up in Vista time to time. It has a strange habit of forgetting things.
I have two prime examples, the other day, when I resumed from Sleep mode in the morning and started outlook, Vista popped up to tell me that Windows Firewall was blocking Outlook and would I like to let it through. What is odd about this, is that I dont run with Windows Firewall enabled, and when I checked the settings, it was still disabled.

And just now, I was testing a local website, which I had been testing earlier in the day, and I couldnt connect to it, I rebooted my machine and still no good, so I had a look into IIS and it had dropped my default documents and my script mappings.
Both these events have been preceeded by changes to my user account, the first I disabled UAC, I didnt actually mean to do this, I was just clicking around, I have since re-enaled it (though not sure why) the second I had just tried to add my domain user account in the local administrators group because it wasnt letting me run iisreset, it still didnt, and hence why I rebooted.
Strange.
Still like the new version though.

In Fox news, the three staff from Quids that attended OzFox are back at work now and full of great ideas, sounds like it was an excellent conference.
