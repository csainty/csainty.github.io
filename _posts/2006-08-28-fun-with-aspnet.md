I have spent the last few days setting up an internal wiki for the office.
I started with a fairly simple and clean looking wiki I found on sourceforge called [ProntoWiki](http://prontowiki.sourceforge.net/)
It is written in ASP.NET, C# and SQL Express 2005, so its a great little app to have a play with these new (for me atleast) technologies and get out of FoxPro for a moment.
Saturday was spent adding the ability to give pages a title that would show instead of the CamelCase key for the page, and writing a Flickr inspired control so we can just click the heading to edit it.
Now I need to go add a few more functions to the parsing routines, I just can't help but fiddle with new toys.
