I was asked last night about what software we use at Quids to test the performance and load capabilities of our websites.
Years ago I started using a tool called WAPT ([link](http://www.loadtestingtool.com/)) which is a commercial product and has given me no problems. It does the basic "record a script and play it back" functionality and has some nice graphs and stats.
Since then Microsoft have updated their tools in this area, but I have not really tried them out sadly.
