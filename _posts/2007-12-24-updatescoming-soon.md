So my blog has been a bit quiet lately. The usual mix of being lazy, busy and just generally lacking anything exciting to blog about has kept me quiet.  
  
I have however penned the first in a series of posts I have been planning on LINQ-to-SQL. Microsoft have put together something very special here and coupled with the numerous language changes they have introduced to support LINQ, I think they have made a major step forward in terms of how we deal with a database from the programming language.    LINQ-to-SQL is far more than just embedding SQL-like statements into your code, and besides I have been doing that for years in FoxPro, so it is not terribly exciting. It's a truly exciting first-party data layer for SQL Sever.  
  
Once I have the first two or three articles put together I will post them up, I want to ensure decent continuity between posts hence the slight hold off on posting the already completed first post.  
  
As a side note, I have started using Live Writer, and it looks great, so bear with me if things get a little screwy around here while posting my first few articles with it. Fingers crossed it goes smooth as silk.    On that note, excuse a quick test of the image upload/hosting from Live Writer, I'd rather know now if this is going to be an issue.

Edit: Looks like it worked! (now to test an edit)
